## Introduction

My goal is to create an application for reading and editing nested lists in plain-text file format:

```
Section:
	- Marked Task 0 @mark
		- Subtask 0
		Note for Subtask 0
		- Completed Subtask 1 @done
	- Task 1
```

## Features

* Creating and editing nested lists of any complexity.
* Ability to customize the style and formatting of lists.
* Drag&Drop support.
* Hotkeys support.

	- Use Editor > New item to create a new item
	- Press ⌘T to create a new item
